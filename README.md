## Overview 
---
The Bamazon app has two parts: the customer view and the manager view. In the customer's view, user can
view a list of products for sale, the price, and can select a product to purchase. If the user selects a quantity of a product that is over the quantity in stock, the app will ask them to select another product or smaller quantity. Once product and quanity are selected, the app will send a "reciept" of the product name, quantity of the order, and the total cost.
In the manager's view, user is able to see all of the product information including price and quantity. The manager can view just the products with low inventory, and then is able to add quantity to those products. There is also a function to add new products which will update the product menu.
